        <P> Happiness is not something you find outside, it’s something you create within yourself.
            It comes from appreciating small moments, being grateful, and maintaining a positive mindset.
        </P>
        <p>Spending time with loved ones, pursuing your passions, and helping others are some of the
            most effective ways to feel truly happy. Happiness grows when shared.
